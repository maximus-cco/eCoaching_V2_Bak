-- Details for Database Encryption

1. Copy cert onto server
Copy the cert file (.pfx) downloaded from TFS to a share on the respective DB server (\\UVAAPADSQL50CCO.ad.local\Apps\Software\Cert2023 for prod)

2. Start cmd prompt as admin and then launch mmc from there
Add the Certificates snap-in for the computer 

3. Import cert to personal cert store (you will need pwd from info.txt)
Right Click Certificates
All tasks
Import
Next
Browse to the public key certificate received from the CA and click Next
Choose the option to place the certificate in the personal store
Click Next and Finish
Certificate should appear in the certificate store, with a Key on the top left corner of the icon and is avilable for use at this point

4. Assign permisison to cert to 'NT Service\MSSQLSERVER' 
Right click cert --> Details --> Manage cert and give full control permission to this accout from local machine

5. Add certificate Thumbprint in Registry to use in encrypting database connections (Thumbprint in info.txt in TFS)

Open up the registry (regedit) and navigate to the SQL Server instance hive. The default location for SQL Server would be:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQL\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib
If your SQL instance is not using the default name, then MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER would instead be replaced with MSSQL11.<Instance Name>.
Create a string value “Certificate” on the above location or modify the already-created value and paste the copied thumbprint value into it.
At the same registry location, change the “ForceEncryption” value to “1” to have SQL Server force encryption.
Once completed, have the DBA restart the SQL Server services to load the SSL Certificate and make the changes take effect
